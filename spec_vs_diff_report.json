  "summary": "The diff implements nearly all 11 requirements comprehensively. All core features are present: localStorage persistence with 15 seeded properties, Indian price formatting, propertyStorage utility, city filter tabs, PropertyPage with carousel and Google Maps link, navy theme redesign, Hero with RERA badge and credentials, testimonials rotator, mobile bottom bar, AdminPanel with Internet Identity, and App.tsx routing. Minor gaps identified below.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Bottom action bar must be exactly 60px tall per REQ-9 AC, but the MobileBottomBar container is set to 64px via inline style.",
      "reason": "REQ-9 AC states 'Bottom bar is 60px tall'. The diff shows style={{ height: '64px' }} on the container div, not 60px.",

    {
      "requirement": "REQ-7 requires the headline to read 'Trusted Delhi Agent | 50+ Deals Closed' as a single headline with pipe separator.",
      "reason": "The AC says the hero displays 'Trusted Delhi Agent | 50+ Deals Closed' as the main headline. The diff renders them on two separate lines using a br tag rather than as a pipe-separated single line.",
