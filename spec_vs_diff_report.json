  "summary": "The diff implements a rotating/cycling CSS animation for two span elements in the Contact section (which appears to be the 6th section). The implementation adds CSS classes `.rotating-heading-wrapper`, `.rotating-heading-span`, `.rotating-span-1`, `.rotating-span-2` and a `@keyframes rotatingSpanIn` animation in `index.css`, and applies these classes to the two spans in `Contact.tsx`. The requirement is substantially addressed, but the truncated diff prevents full verification of animation parameters.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-30",
      "requirement": "The CSS keyframe animation must use opacity + translateY (~0.4s ease) transitions, staggered animation-delay so span[2] begins after span[1] completes, each span visible ~2 seconds, continuous infinite loop, and spans stacked vertically (display:block or flex-direction:column on parent).",
      "reason": "The diff truncates index.css before the actual keyframe definitions and class rules for .rotating-heading-wrapper, .rotating-span-1, .rotating-span-2 are visible. The file summary mentions @keyframes rotatingSpanIn but does not confirm: (1) opacity+translateY transitions, (2) ~0.4s ease duration, (3) ~2s visible window per span, (4) staggered delay, (5) display:block/flex-column stacking, or (6) infinite looping. These specific animation parameters cannot be verified from the truncated diff.",
