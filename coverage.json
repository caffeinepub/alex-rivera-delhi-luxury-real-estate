        "summary": "In the 6th section of the page, locate the parent container at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[6]/div[1]/div[1] and its two child <span> elements (XPath span[1] and span[2]). Stack the two spans vertically so each appears on its own line (display: block or flex-direction: column on the parent). Implement a CSS animation that cycles through the spans one at a time: each span fades/slides in, stays visible for ~2 seconds, then fades/slides out before the next one appears, creating a continuous rotating/cycling text effect. Use CSS keyframe animations with an appropriate staggered animation-delay so span[2] begins its cycle after span[1] has completed its display window. The transition between spans must be smooth (opacity + translateY, approximately 0.4s ease). Do not alter any other elements outside this container.",
